# Composite Design Pattern

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you build complex hierarchical structures
where individual objects and groups of objects are treated uniformly.

It's especially useful when dealing with tree-like data models such as
file systems, graphical scenes, or organizational charts.

The core idea of the Composite Pattern is to define a common interface for both
simple (leaf) and composite (container) objects.

This way, clients can interact with all elements in the structure without needing to know
whether they are dealing with a single item or a nested group.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a file system:

1. A File is a single unit (leaf).
2. A Folder can contain files or other folders (composite).
3. Yet both expose the same operations like open(), delete(), or getSize() - that's the Composite Pattern in action.

## Structure

**Component**: An abstract interface declaring common methods (e.g., display(), add()).

**Leaf**: Implements the component interface; represents end objects (e.g., files, buttons).

**Composite**: Implements the component interface; contains and manages child components.

## When to Use

Use the Composite Pattern when:

1. You need to represent a tree-like hierarchy of objects.
2. You want to treat individual and grouped items uniformly.
3. Your client code shouldn't care if it's working with a leaf or a group.

**Common examples include**:

1. GUI component hierarchies (buttons inside panels, inside windows).
1. File and directory structures.
1. Organizational charts.

## Benefits

**Uniformity**: Treats individual objects and composites the same way.

**Scalability**: Easy to add new leaf or composite types without changing existing code.

**Simplified Client Code**: Clients don�t need to know object internals � they use the shared interface.

## Drawbacks

**Over-generalization**: Makes it hard to enforce constraints (e.g., restrict adding children to leaf nodes).

**Can Obscure Type-Specific Logic**: Clients may need type-checking if specialized behavior is required.

Potentially **Over-Engineered** for flat or non-hierarchical use cases.
