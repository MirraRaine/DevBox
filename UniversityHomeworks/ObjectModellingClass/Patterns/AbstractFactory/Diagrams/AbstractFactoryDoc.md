# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families
of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other 
factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories.

It's particularly useful when your code needs to work with various families of products,
but you want to enforce consistency within each family.
Instead of instantiating products directly, the client relies on a factory to create objects,
making the system more flexible and decoupled.

The core idea is to abstract the process of object creation so that the client can work with interfaces or abstract classes,
leaving the actual instantiation to concrete factory classes that produce related product variants.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're ordering furniture for your home.
You decide to go with a brand that offers complete sets—Victorian-style or Modern-style.
When you choose the Victorian-style set, you get a Victorian chair, sofa, and coffee table —
all matching in design and function. You don't mix a Modern sofa with a Victorian chair.
The furniture factory ensures consistency across products in a given style.

**Abstract Factory** works the same way in code:
it provides a way to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Structure

The **Abstract Factory** pattern involves several key components:

* **AbstractFactory**: Declares a set of creation methods for abstract products (e.g., `createChair()`, `createSofa()`).
* **ConcreteFactory**: Implements the creation methods to produce specific variants of products (e.g., `ModernFurnitureFactory`, `VictorianFurnitureFactory`).
* **AbstractProduct**: Defines interfaces for a set of products (e.g., `Chair`, `Sofa`).
* **ConcreteProduct**: Implements the abstract product interfaces (e.g., `ModernChair`, `VictorianChair`).
* **Client**: Uses only interfaces declared by the abstract factory and products; it remains agnostic to the specific variants used.

```plaintext
     Client
       |
   AbstractFactory
   /             \
ConcreteFactory1  ConcreteFactory2
   |                   |
Products (A1, B1)   Products (A2, B2)
```

## When to Use

* When your system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, or represented.
* When you want to enforce consistency among products in a family.
* When you anticipate needing to support multiple families of products.

**Examples:**

* GUI toolkits that need to support different themes (e.g., Windows, macOS).
* Cross-platform apps where components differ per platform.

## Benefits

* **Encapsulation of object creation**: Keeps creation logic centralized.
* **Consistency among related objects**: Ensures products from the same family work well together.
* **Scalability**: Adding new families is easy—just add a new factory.

## Drawbacks

* **Complexity**: Increases the number of classes in your system.
* **Inflexibility**: Harder to add new kinds of products (you must modify all factories).

## Comment

It's really hard to create new products because products always come in pairs: the circle is red, the triangle is green.
But let's say I want to keep all that, and now circles also get an additional property—like being semi-transparent.
If I add this method to the interface, it would turn out that triangles and squares could also be semi-transparent,
which isn't true.
  
  /*


In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory 
of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated 
factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.

Implementation

We are going to create a Shape and Color interfaces and concrete classes 
implementing these interfaces. We create an abstract factory class 
AbstractFactory as next step. Factory classes ShapeFactory and ColorFactory are 
defined where each factory extends AbstractFactory. A factory creator/generator
class FactoryProducer is created.

AbstractFactoryPatternDemo, our demo class uses FactoryProducer to get a 
AbstractFactory object. It will pass information (CIRCLE / RECTANGLE / SQUARE for Shape)
to AbstractFactory to get the type of object it needs. It also passes information 
(RED / GREEN / BLUE for Color) to AbstractFactory to get the type of object it needs.
