# Builder Design Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

It is particularly useful when an object needs to be created step-by-step, or when its construction involves multiple parts that need to be assembled in a specific order. Instead of having a large constructor or exposing internal structure to the client, the pattern hides the building logic inside dedicated builder classes.

The core idea is to delegate the construction of an object to a builder, which assembles the object one piece at a time. This results in cleaner, more maintainable code and allows the same building process to be reused for creating different configurations of an object.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine ordering a meal at a fast-food restaurant. Instead of preparing the meal yourself, you tell the staff what you want: a burger, fries, and a drink. The staff assembles your order step by step using predefined components (items), and you receive the completed meal as a finished product.

**In software**, the Builder pattern encapsulates the construction process of a complex object so it can be created step-by-step with different configurations, without exposing the internal logic.

                                 v
                              Product
```

### Components:

| Component           | Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product**         | The complex object being built (`Meal`)                                 |
| **Builder**         | Interface that defines the steps (`MealBuilder`)                        |
| **ConcreteBuilder** | Provides implementation of building steps (`MealBuilder`)               |
| **Director**        | Optional. Controls the construction process (e.g. `Client` or `Main()`) |
| **Client**          | Asks the builder to build a product                                     |

## When to Use

* When the construction process must allow different representations of an object.
* When the object to be built is complex and involves multiple parts (e.g., UI components, configurations, meals).
* When you want to isolate the logic of object construction from its final representation.

## Benefits

* **Separation of concerns**: Builder separates construction logic from business logic.
* **Step-by-step creation**: Supports incremental construction of complex objects.
* **Fluent interfaces**: Can enable readable chained method calls.
* **Reusability**: Builders can construct different types of products using the same process.

## Drawbacks

* **Increased complexity**: Adds more classes compared to simple construction.
* **Overhead**: Not always necessary for small or simple objects.
