    /*Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java.
  This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides
  one of the best ways to create an object.

  This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object 
  while making sure that only single object gets created. 
  This class provides a way to access its only object
  which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.*/

        //make the constructor private so that this class cannot be
        //instantiated
        private SingleObject() { }

        //Get the only object available
