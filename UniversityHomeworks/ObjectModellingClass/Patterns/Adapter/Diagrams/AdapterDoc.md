# Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the client.

## Real-World Analogy

Think of a power adapter. A laptop charger with a US plug doesn’t fit into a European socket. The power adapter converts the plug shape and voltage to match the European standard. Similarly, in software, an adapter converts one interface into another expected by the client.


## Structure

```
Client --> Target Interface <-- Adapter --> Adaptee
```

* **Target**: The interface expected by the client.
* **Adaptee**: The existing class that needs adapting.
* **Adapter**: Implements the Target interface and translates requests from the client to the Adaptee.

## When to Use

* You want to use an existing class, but its interface doesn't match the one you need.
* You need to reuse legacy code in a new system without modifying the original code.
* Third-party or external systems provide interfaces that can’t be modified but must integrate.

## Benefits

* Promotes **code reusability** without modifying existing code.
* Helps in **integrating with legacy systems** or third-party libraries.
* Follows **Open/Closed Principle** – open for extension, closed for modification.
* Improves **decoupling** between client code and adaptee classes.

## Drawbacks

* Increases complexity by adding another layer.
* Overuse can lead to unnecessary abstraction.
* Performance overhead in some cases due to additional delegation.
