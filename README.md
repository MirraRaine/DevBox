# University Homework & Practice Archive

This repository contains a curated collection of programming exercises, assignments, and small projects
I completed during my university studies roughly 10-12 years ago.

Originally written in Java, these tasks have recently been revisited and rewritten in C# with light improvements
in structure, naming, formatting, and test coverage.

I never published this code during my university years - and for a long time, it just sat on my drive.
Revisiting it now brings both nostalgia and motivation.
It's satisfying to see how far I've come, and I hope keeping this archive will inspire continued growth.

## Disclaimer

These projects are not meant to represent production-grade code.
They represent a significant part of my journey as a developer, reflect the learning phase of my career, and while they have been cleaned up for clarity,
they remain primarily educational in purpose.

## Purpose

- **Reflection**: To look back and appreciate how much Iï¿½ve grown as a developer.
- **Refactoring**: odernizing the code in C# while staying true to the original logic.
- **Practice**: Adding unit tests to old assignments to revisit testing principles.
- **Preservation**: Keeping this work stored safely and publicly, rather than hidden away on a local drive.
- **Learning Archive**: Serving as a resource for personal retrospection and informal reference.

## What's Inside

- Design Pattern Examples (Adapter, Builder, etc.)
- Basic Algorithms and Data Structures
- University Assignments (Converted from Java to C#)
- Unit Tests using MSTest

## Tools Used

- Language: C#
- IDE: Visual Studio
- Testing: MSTest
